        In percolation, the water passes through the coffee grounds, gaining soluble compounds to form coffee. Insoluble
        compounds remain within the coffee filter.
        Coffee can be brewed in several different ways, but these methods fall into four main groups depending on how
        the water is introduced to the coffee grounds: decoction (through boiling), infusion (through steeping),
        gravitational feed (used with percolators and in drip brewing), or pressurized percolation (as with espresso).

    <p>
        Boiling, or decoction, was the main method used for brewing coffee until the 1930s and is still used in some
        Nordic and Middle Eastern countries. The aromatic oils in coffee are released at 96 °C (205 °F), which is just
        below boiling, while the bitter acids are released when the water has reached boiling point.

  <p>    
    A cafetière, or French press, is a tall, narrow cylinder with a plunger that includes a metal or nylon fine mesh
    filter. The grounds are placed in the cylinder, and off-the- boil water is then poured into it. The coffee and hot
    water are left in the cylinder for a few minutes (typically 4–7 minutes) and then the plunger is gently pushed down,
    leaving the filter immediately above the grounds, allowing the coffee to be poured out while the filter retains the
    grounds. Depending on the type of filter, it is important to pay attention to the grind of the coffee beans, though
    a rather coarse grind is almost always called for.  </p>

<h3 id="Filtration"> Filtration methods</h3>
<p>
    Drip brew coffee, also known as filtered or American coffee, is made by letting hot water drip onto coffee grounds
    held in a coffee filter surrounded by a filter holder or brew basket. Drip brew makers can be simple filter holder
    types manually filled with hot water, or they can use automated systems as found in the popular electric drip
    coffee-maker. Strength varies according to the ratio of water to coffee and the fineness of the grind, but is
    typically weaker than espresso, though the final product contains more caffeine. By convention, regular coffee
    brewed by this method is served by some restaurants in a brown or black pot (or a pot with a brown or black handle),
    while decaffeinated coffee is served in an orange pot (or a pot with an orange handle).

<h3 id="Pressure">Pressure</h3>
<p>
    Espresso is made by forcing hot water at 91–95 °C (195–204 °F) under a pressure of between eight and eighteen bars
    (800–1800 kPa, 116–261 psi), through a lightly packed matrix, called a "puck," of finely ground coffee. The 30–60 cc
    (1–2 oz.) beverage is served in demitasse cups; sugar is often added. It is consumed during the day at cafes and
    from street vendors, or after an evening meal. It is the basis for many coffee drinks. It is one of the most
    concentrated forms of coffee regularly consumed, with a distinctive flavor provided by crema, a layer of flavorful
    emulsified oils in the form of a colloidal foam floating on the surface, which is produced by the high pressure.
    Espresso is more viscous than other forms of brewed coffee.
